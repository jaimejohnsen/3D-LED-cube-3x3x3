# 3D-LED-cube-3x3x3
This LED cube displays various light patterns and shapes based on a 3D grid system.
This project is useful in learning soldering techniques, identifying and soldering
through hole components, and progamming.

I am using the Velleman mini-kit 3DLED Cube 3x3x3 (MK193).  However, this kit is no longer 
available and further documentation is listed under WSL193.  An official schematic was not
available and I have located one similar and will post the documentation.
